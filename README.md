# Data-Mining-Classification-BER

## Overview

This project performs a classification analysis on building energy efficiency ratings (Building Energy Rating, BER) in Ireland. The goal is to identify key predictors of high and low energy efficiency using machine learning techniques. This analysis can guide property owners on energy efficiency upgrades to improve their BER ratings.

## Files in Repository

- **BERPublicsearch.csv**: Dataset containing energy assessments of residential and commercial buildings, with various attributes that impact energy efficiency.
- **ber.py**: Python script implementing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using classification algorithms.

## Objectives

- **Classification**: Use machine learning models to classify buildings as high or low energy efficient.
- **Feature Analysis**: Determine the most significant factors that predict energy efficiency.
- **Cost-Benefit Insights**: Provide insights on potential cost-benefits for property owners considering BER improvements.

## Deliverables

- **ber.py**: Python code file with the complete data mining workflow, including data cleaning, model training, and evaluation.
- **Presentation**: (To be added) Summarizes key findings, model evaluation, and a cost-benefit analysis for improving BER.

## Algorithms

The following classification algorithms are implemented in `ber.py`:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Random Forest**

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The ability of the model to capture all true positives.
- **F1 Score**: A balance between precision and recall.

## Conclusion

This project reveals important factors influencing building energy efficiency and offers a cost-benefit perspective for property owners. The results can help in making informed decisions for enhancing building energy performance.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the folder.
